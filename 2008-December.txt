Subject: [smb4k-devel] Konqueror plugin for KDE 4 version
Message-ID: <200812231440.18181.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Hello everyone,

yesterday night I wondered if porting the Konqueror plugin to KDE 4 was a hard 
thing to do. I started to port it and three hours later the code compiled. 
However, the plugin is still not working, because everytime I try to add it to 
Konqueror's side bar, Konqueror freezes and an error message  similar to this 
one is shown in the shell:

QString::arg: Argument missing: /konqsidebartng//entries/, 542512

I tried to find out what happens here, but I did not succeed. Googling for the 
error indicated that a falsely formatted string (most likely with a wrong 
substitution like %1 or similar) is passed somewhere, but I couldn't find it.

Massimo, do you have any idea what's going one here?

The new code is in CVS. If you want to compile the Konqueror plugin, add the 
following argument to the cmake command line: -DCOMPILE_KONQPLUGIN=true

For those of you, who celebrate christmas: Merry Christmas! 

Best regards
Alexander
