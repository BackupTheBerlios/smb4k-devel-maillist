Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.7 released
Message-ID: <201004070817.06216.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

The seventh maintenance release of Smb4K 0.10 has been made available today. 
It fixes the invalid option errors thrown by smb4k_umount when trying to 
unmount any share.

Please note that also this version does not ship with the translations from 
l10n-kde4!

ChangeLog:
- Replace broken backported smb4k_umount binary with a fixed one from the 
  0.10 branch. This way you won't get the "unknown argument" errors anymore.
