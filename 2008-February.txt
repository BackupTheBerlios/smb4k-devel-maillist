Subject: [smb4k-devel] Status of KDE 4 port
Message-ID: <200802051954.08746.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone,

I wanted to give you an update on the KDE 4 port of Smb4K which will 
eventually lead to the next major release.

The core, the dialog classes, the configuration dialog, the main window (which 
is only a skeleton) and the system tray widget compile at the moment. This 
are the states of these components:

(1) Core:
The mounter and bookmark handler work. The other classes are either untested 
or exhibit still grave problems. I'm currently working on the synchronizer 
that seems to stop working during synchronization although rsync is still 
active.

(2) Dialogs:
The mount dialog and the synchronization dialog have been tested and seem to 
work. The rest is untested.

(3) Main window:
The main window is only a skeleton, because I replaced the old Smb4KApp with 
the new Smb4KMainWindow class which contains only rudimentary code.

(4) Configuration dialog:
The configuration dialog compiles, but cannot be loaded via KPluginLoader at 
the moment. Thus, it is not tested.

(5) System tray widget:
Works. The only problem is that the configuration dialog cannot be started.

The rest of the classes has not been (fully) ported yet.

If you want to help porting the application, please note that the build system 
has been changed. We are now using cmake instead of the autoconf/automake 
combo. Thus the configuration works a little bit different:

(1) Check out CVS HEAD:
    $ cvs -z3 -d<login>@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/smb4k co -P smb4k

(2) Create a build directory, i.e. smb4k_build:
    $ mkdir smb4k_build

(3) Run the following command to set up the build directory and configure the 
source:
    $ cmake -GKdevelop3 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install_dir \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug /path/to/source_dir /path/to/build_dir
The argument "-GKdevelop3" is optional. It creates a KDevelop3 project file in 
the build directory which is useful if you are using KDevelop for 
development.

(4) Now run
    $ make
    $ make install
from the build directory to compile the source.

(5) The source must be modified in the source directory. If you are using 
KDevelop with the generated project file you will have immediately access to 
the correct files.

Help is greatly appreciated.

Have a nice day!

Bye
Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.9.3 released
Message-ID: <200802240938.27952.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

This version comes with a backport from the current development branch that 
improves the handling of login information. To achieve this, the format of 
the data that is written to the wallet had to be changed and, thus, Smb4K 
0.9.3 is not compatible with earlier versions. The conversion of the old data 
will be done automatically. Apart from that two (un)mount issues and a 
regression in the network browser have been eliminated.

ChangeLog:
- Revised and optimized the code of the password handler. One consequence
  is, that the format of the wallet entries is not compatible with previous
  versions. The old entries will be converted automatically.
- Fixed a regression in the browser, where the list of shares was not deleted
  when an host item was collapsed.
- Fixed an unmount problem that occurred when mount.smbfs is indeed a symlink 
  to or a copy of mount.cifs.
- The mount command now includes the NetBIOS name of the local host, which
  is at least needed when using port 139.
