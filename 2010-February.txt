Subject: [smb4k-devel] Release of Smb4K 0.10.5
Message-ID: <201002161650.52730.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Hello!

I'm Alexander Reinholdt, the main developer of Smb4K. I was notified that our 
latest release caused some irritation among the KDE translators because it was 
not published with the translations from l10n-kde4. So, I would like to 
explain the situation.

First of all I want to stress that we appreciate the work of the KDE 
translators very much and we did not mean to offend or intimidate anyone.

Smb4K 0.10 is the predecessor of the version that is in KDE playground and is 
still hosted at BerliOS (We imported a development snapshot without any 
history into KDE SVN a few months ago.). Smb4K 0.10.5 has been packaged from 
that branch outside KDE. Additionally, since there are approximately 18 months 
of development between Smb4K 0.10 and the version in playground, the messages 
already diviate significantly, so that it would not make much sense to copy the 
new translations to the "old" source code.

For the next major release will definitely use the translations from l10n-kde4 
and I want to apologize for any misunderstanding and irritation caused.

Best regards
Alexander
