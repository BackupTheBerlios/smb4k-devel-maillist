Message-ID: <200910011906.25898.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Only one day after version 0.10.3 was released, Smb4K 0.10.4 has been made 
available. It fixed a crash in the main window that was introduced in the last 
release due to my carelessness. Sorry for any inconvenience!

ChangeLog:
- Fixed crash in the main window that made Smb4K unusable when no bookmarks
  were defined.

Hello again!

I got my SVN account a few days ago and I'm now ready to upload Smb4K to KDE 
playground.

How does the procedure work? Do I send you a tarball or upload Smb4K directly? 
I do not care so much about our project's history. I assume this simplifies the 
inclusion into KDE's SVN repository considerably.

Please note that I will be unavailable until Sunday night.

Best regards
Alexander

That sounds great.

Do I have to adjust the code prior to the upload or can it get in unchanged? 
What about the localization files?

If there are no objections, I'd like to commit the code to the network module.

Best regards
Alexander

As you don't care about the project history,
you can commit smb4k source code directly into KDE's SVN.

cheers,

OK, thanks.

Sorry, I should have written network subfolder and not module. I know that I 
first need to go through kdereview before I'm allowed to put the software to 
extragear or the KDE modules. 

Thanks for the contact. I'll approach Urs if necessary when I decided where to 
put Smb4K after kdereview.

I'll commit Smb4K to playground/network shortly.

Best regards
Alexander

Message-ID: <200910310946.52826.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Today I imported Smb4K HEAD to KDE Playground [1]. From now on, development 
will take place there. Our CVS repository at BerliOS will still be used for 
maintenance of the stable branches, though. Many thanks to the KDE sysadmin 
team who helped with the transition.

You can check out the latest development snapshot with anonymous SVN:

$ svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/network/smb4k
