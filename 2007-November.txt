Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.9.0 release schedule
Message-ID: <1242776327@web.de>

Hello everyone,

although I have been very quiet within the last months about the development of Smb4K, I'm happy to report that the main application is now in a very good shape for release and that the Konqueror plugin is currently being ported to the new GUI code. Thus, I want to announce the following release schedule for Smb4K 0.9.0:

18.11.2007:   Beta version 

02.12.2007:   Release candidate

16.12.2007:   Release of 0.9.0

Please note that this schedule may be changed if some problems occur.

The messages are now frozen and it is the best time to translate the updated PO files. Since most of the GUI has been rewritten, there are many new strings and a lot of work to do. 

For the translations I want to restate the policy for inclusion in the release. All PO files that have 50% and more translated strings will be incorporated. Unfortunately there are only about 5 meeting this requirement at the moment. I would be very pleased if we could boost this number.

The 0.9 series will be the last KDE 3 branch of Smb4K. I decided to move the application completely to KDE 4 afterwards.

Have a nice day

Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Beta version of Smb4K 0.9.0 released
Message-ID: <200711181135.18272.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

After about eleven months of development, the Smb4K team is pleased to 
announce the beta version of Smb4K 0.9.0. It comes with an almost entirely 
rewritten GUI and many other changes under the hood such as a new 
configuration system. For this reason, we want to encourage all our users to 
test this pre-release and report [1] any problems and bugs.

As you will notice, many of the translations have not been updated yet and 
several are even abandoned. If you want your language to be supported by 
Smb4K 0.9.0, we would be very pleased if you would help us. You can do so by 
sending patches [2] for existing translation or by contributing [3] a new 
one. Please contact the official translator to coordinate your work.

Please note:
* KDE 3.3 is required to compile this version of Smb4K.
* The Konqueror plugin is work in progress, i.e. not all features have been 
  implemented yet. Please do not report any bugs regarding this issue.
* Smb4K 0.9.0beta will remove your old configuration file during the first 
  start-up. You should backup your $HOME/.kde/share/config/smb4krc file if you 
  plan on reverting to an earlier version later on.

The source code can be downloaded from our FTP site [4]. The ChangeLog file is 
included in the source file.

For the Smb4K team
Alexander Reinholdt

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.8.7 released
Message-ID: <200711280749.30659.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

This maintenance release of the 0.8 branch predominantly fixes problems 
experienced when mounting and unmounting shares. This will especially please 
our FreeBSD users who could not work with previous version because of these 
bugs. Besides, the smb4k_cat utility has been revised, so that a corruption 
of the /etc/sudoers or /etc/super.tab file should not occur anymore.

ChangeLog:
- Fixed smb4k_cat utility program:
  + Enlarged the allowed length per line to 1024 (instead of 255) characters 
    (closes #12262).
  + Fixed a bug that could lead to corrupted files.
- Fixed Smb4KPasswordHandler::readDefaultAuth() that returned a pointer that 
  was freed when the function exited.
- Fixed Smb4KMounter:
  + Smb4K won't consider foreign shares for remounting on start-up. This also 
    seems to solve the crash bug initially  reported in #11973 (closes #11467
    and #12369).
  + Fixed unmount command line in slotShutdown() function under FreeBSD.
  + Fixed unmount command line in unmount() function under FreeBSD.

Checksums:
MD5 sum: 4ea8a3ffda9f67170cbc588a03d8fe97  smb4k-0.8.7.tar.bz2
