<PRE>Hello everyone,

it has been quite a while since I wrote my last e-mail. After my relocation 
and the first weeks in my new job, I finally settled and restarted to 
actively develop Smb4K. 

There are two versions I'm currently working on. This is on the one hand Smb4K 
0.8.1 which introduces several fixes to security flaws that were found in the 
utility programs after version 0.8.0 was released. And, on the other hand, 
I'm rewriting the GUI and restructuring the source code for HEAD. The latter 
is only done locally on my hard drive at the moment, because I haven't 
decided yet whether I'll upload the code to our CVS repository or if I should 
commit it to the SVN repository which I setup a few months ago...

For Smb4K 0.8.1, I want to encourage the translators to revise their PO files. 
It would be great if we could ship the new version with updated translations.

OK, that's it for now. Have a nice day!

Bye
Alexander
