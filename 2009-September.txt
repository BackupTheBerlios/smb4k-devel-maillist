Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.3 released
Message-ID: <200909302032.30575.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

The third maintenance release of Smb4K 0.10 has been released today. It fixes 
two crashes and several other minor bugs. Due to comprehensive changes, the 
soname of the core library has been bumped to 3.2.0.

ChangeLog:
- Fixed failing of error recognition when mounting shares with Samba >= 3.3.
- Backported Smb4KAuthInfo class from CVS HEAD. This should close the crash
  in Smb4KAuthInfo::unc() under KDE 4.3.
- Fixed network search code so that no comment shows up in the UNC with longer
  share names.
- Silenced enscript, so that no erroneous error messages are shown when 
  printing.
- Bumped soname of core library to version 3.2.0.
- Fixed crash in system tray and a potential one in the main window
  (closes #15970).
- Fixed saving and restoring of main window layout.
