Subject: [smb4k-devel] String freeze
Message-ID: <200708141918.21753.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone!

In the last few days I corrected several spelling mistakes, changed some 
messages and switched several other messages to use the double quotation 
marks instead of the single ones. And now I'm pleased to announce the *string 
freeze* for the main application (the messages of the plugin are not yet 
frozen, since development is still in progress).

Bye
Alexander
