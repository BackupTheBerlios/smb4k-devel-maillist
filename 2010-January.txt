Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.9.10 released
Message-ID: <201001301857.01917.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Smb4K 0.9.10 has been made available today. It is the latest and final 
maintenance release for the KDE 3 branch of Smb4K and comes with several fixes 
for problems that surfaced within the last year.

ChangeLog:
- Prevent the scanner from trying to do something before the application
  has completely started up.
- Replaced Smb4KPasswordHandler class with the backported Smb4KWalletManager
  class (should close #14703).
- Smb4KHomesSharesHandler class has to be accessed via a static pointer
  now.
- Fixed problems with Samba 3.3 (among others closes #15276).
- Revised Smb4KGlobal namespace:
  + Removed passwordHandler() function. Use Smb4KWalletManager::self()
    instead.
  + Removed homesHandler() function. Use Smb4KHomesSharesHandler::self()
    instead.
  + Removed timer() function. It was long deprecated and not used 
    anymore.
- Adjusted code to use the new infrastructure.
- Fixed compilation errors under CentOS 4.8.
- Bumped version of the core library to 2.1.0.
