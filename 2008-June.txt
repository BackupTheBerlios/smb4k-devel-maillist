Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.9.5 released
Message-ID: <200806011756.53717.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

This release fixes a logon issue that was introduced in version 0.9.4: Smb4K 
sent the login and password to the master browser by default when asking for 
the browse list. This could cause at least master browsers running Samba to 
return an empty browse list. This behavior has now been made configurable and 
can be enabled in the configuration dialog under Network | Authentication | 
Master browsers need authentication. It is turned off by default.

ChangeLog:
- Fixed an authentication issue that occurred when the master browser 
  was queried for the workgroup members.
- Added a configuration entry that must be enabled when authentication 
  information needs to be send to the workgroup master browser when 
  querying it for the browse list.

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.0alpha and 0.9.6
Message-ID: <200806081338.06126.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone,

the whole code base except the Konqueror plugin is now ported KDE 4. There are 
only a few improvements I want to implement before a first alpha release can 
be made available. Also, most of the messages won't be changed before the 
final release, so that you can already start to translate them.

If everything develops as expected, I think we can publish the alpha release 
of Smb4K 0.10.0 in about one or two weeks.

The only question that is left for decision is if we should keep the Konqueror 
plugin or if we should remove it and replace it with a plugin for Dolphin or 
even something different. What do you think, Massimo? Maybe I should add here, 
that I plan to implement a plasmoid when the Plasma documentation has matured.

During some testing of the development version, I found a crash that is also 
present in the stable branch. I fixed it and added a backport of the new 
synchronizer code from head that eliminates some minor bugs in the 
synchronization dialog. This makes another maintenance release necessary. I 
will try to release it within the next week. So, if you want to update your 
translation in the stable branch, please do it until Wednesday 11th.

Have a nice weekend

Bye
Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.9.6 released
Message-ID: <200806150924.15027.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

During a code review a crash in the network search code and a problem with 
unquoted paths were found and eliminated. In addition, the synchronization 
code was fixed.

ChangeLog:
- Fixed crash when the search item was empty: Pressing RETURN instead
  of activating the search action will not start a search and
  Smb4KScanner::search() now just returns when the search string is
  empty.
- Revised synchronization.
  + Rewrote Smb4KSynchronizer::slotReceivedStdout().
  + Fixed missing total file number in the synchronization dialog.
  + Fixed error message when the cancel button was pressed.
  + Removed obsolete code for old rsync versions.
- Fixed unquoted path in Smb4KCore::open(), so that also paths ending
  with '$' are opened correctly in Konsole.

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.0alpha & schedule for release
Message-ID: <200806211957.43777.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone,

today I finished the last item on my list that I wanted to implement before an 
alpha release: the drag and drop support in the shares view. And I think now 
is the time to release the first version to the public. This will be done 
tomorrow. However there are still features missing. Especially the main window 
does still need a bit of work and there are also one or two other things I 
want to implement.

I plan to release at least two additional beta versions before the final 
version will be made available, so that the schedule for release will roughly 
look like this:

22.06.2008: Release Smb4K 0.10.0alpha
06.07.2008: Release Smb4K 0.10.0beta1
20.07.2008: Release Smb4K 0.10.0beta2
03.08.2008: Release Smb4K 0.10.0

This schedule might still be changed if some unexpected showstoppers appear.

Since most of the messages won't change until the final release, you can 
already start to translate the messages. They can be checked out by running 
the following command in the shell:

$ cvs -d<login>@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/smb4k co -P smb4k/po

Please note that due to our new build system, the translations are not stored 
under po/<lang>.po anymore but under po/<lang>/smb4k.po.

If you want to check out the whole source code and test it or help with 
development, you should run the following command:

$ cvs -d<login>@cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/smb4k co -P smb4k

Compilation of the source should be done in an extra build directory. It can 
be set up like this:

$ mkdir smb4k_build
$ cd  smb4k_build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_prefix> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug . 
<path_to_source>

If you want cmake to generate KDevelop project files, add the -GKDevelop3 
argument.

Please note that the Konqueror plugin is not enabled by default, because it is 
not ported yet. To enable it, e.g. if you want to port it, also add the 
-DCOMPILE_KONQPLUGIN=true argument.

That's it for now.

Have a nice weekend!

Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.0alpha released
Message-ID: <200806221103.22302.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

We are proud to announce the immediate availability of the alpha release of 
Smb4K 0.10.0, the first version that runs (only) under KDE 4. Although it is 
not adequate for daily use, Smb4K 0.10.0alpha is already quite stable. 
However, there are most certainly still bugs. Thus, we want to encourage our 
users to report any problems to our bug tracker at 
http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=769.

Compared to the current stable 0.9 branch many changes have been made and old 
cruft has been eliminated. If you want to have an overview of all 
modifications, please refer to the ChangeLog file within the source tarball.

Since we changed to cmake instead of automake & friends with this version, the 
configuration is now done in a different way. Do as follows to configure and 
compile Smb4K:

1. Extract the source tarball:

   $ tar xvfj smb4k-0.10.0alpha.tar.bz2

2. Create a build directory:

   $ mkdir smb4k_build
   
   At the moment this is not yet mandatory, but strongly adviced.
  
3. Change into the build directory:
      
   $ cd smb4k_build

4. Configure the source:
   
   $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[prefix] -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug . \
     [path_to_source]
      
   Replace [prefix] with the prefix of your KDE installation and
   [path_to_source] with the path to the source code. If you do not want to
   compile Smb4K with debug symbols, replace 'Debug' with 'Release'. KDevelop
   project files can be generated with the additional -GKDevelop3 argument.

5. Now compile and install Smb4K:
      
   $ make && make install

   If you want to be able to remove Smb4K with your package manager later on,
   use checkinstall instead of make install. The package should be present in
   your distribution's repository.

Please note that this alpha version still lacks some features. Especially the 
Konqueror plugin has not been ported and we haven't decided yet if it will be 
in the final version. To help us with the decision, you can participate in a 
survey we set up at 
https://developer.berlios.de/survey/survey.php?group_id=769&survey_id=167.

The source code of this pre-release can be downloaded from 
http://prdownload.berlios.de/smb4k/smb4k-0.10.0alpha.tar.bz2

Hello Martin,

most of the strings will be the same. I'll update the translation in HEAD with 
the one from 09 and commit it then (this evening).

Bye
