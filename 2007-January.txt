Subject: [smb4k-devel] Moving next week / future plan for Smb4K
Message-ID: <200701241835.09660.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone,

next week, I will move and start my new job. Thus, I may be absent 
for a while until I'll have telephone and a DSL connection again.

Although you haven't seen any commits to CVS since the release of version 
0.8.0, Smb4K HEAD is in heavy development. I'm in the middle of rewriting the 
GUI and moving it to KParts. Additionally, the program will use KConfig XT 
[1] and KConfigDialog in the future, i.e. that the old configuration dialog 
will be replace with a new more KDE-compliant one. I'm confident that all 
these changes will make the maintainance of the code easier. Expect the first 
commits of the new code to the CVS (or SVN, see below) repository in the 
middle or at the end of February.

Some time ago, Massimo and I discussed moving to the Subversion repository and 
we both think that it would be superior to CVS. We haven't decided yet if or 
when we will move but it seems a good idea to do it with the next big commit 
to HEAD (i.e. in February). What do you think about this? Any comments or 
objections?

That's it for now. Have a nice week!

Bye
Alexander
