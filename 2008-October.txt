Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.9.8 released
Message-ID: <200810101821.57751.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

The Smb4K team today released another update to the 0.9 series of Smb4K. 
Version 0.9.8 comes with the backported fix for the broken sudoers file issue. 
The fix comprises the replacement of the utility programs smb4k_cat and 
smb4k_mv by the new smb4k_sudowriter command and the removal of the support of 
the program super (You have to to reconfigure Smb4K if you used super until 
now.). To reflect these changes, the handbook has been updated.

ChangeLog:
- Backported smb4k_sudowriter utility program. It directly writes to 
  the /etc/sudoers file and thus finally fixes the messed-up-sudoers-file
  bug.
- Removed smb4k_cat utility program. It's not needed anymore.
- Removed smb4k_mv utility program. It's not needed anymore.
- Removed the support for the program 'super'. If you used it before, you 
  need to reconfigure Smb4K.
- Completely rewrote Smb4KFileIO class to support smb4k_sudowriter.
- Removed the "Programs" widget from the "Super User" configuration page.
  It is not needed anymore.

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.1 released
Message-ID: <200810130018.15166.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Version 0.10.1 is the first maintenance release for the KDE 4.x branch of 
Smb4K. It fixed a bug that caused Smb4K to enter an infinite loop on start-up 
when custom options were defined and two issues in the smb4k_sudowriter 
utility program. Additionally, two other minor problems were eliminated.

ChangeLog:
- Fixed compilation errors due to missing #include statements.
- Fixed a wrong test string in Smb4KMounter::processMount().
- Fixed a crash and a bug in the smb4k_sudowriter utility program. Bumped
  version to 0.2.
- Fixed an infinite loop in Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler::readCustomOptions().
