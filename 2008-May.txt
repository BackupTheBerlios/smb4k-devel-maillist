Hello everyone,

while working on the KDE 4 port, I discovered a bug in the scanner code of the 
stable branch that makes another bugfix release necessary. The release will 
contain a new configuration item, that needs to be translated. So, I want to 
encourage our translators to update their translations.

The KDE 4 port slowly takes form. The last few days I fixed several bugs and 
implemented new features in the main window. The only thing that is still 
missing is the shares view. I plan to start porting it next weekend. So, I 
hope we can release a first alpha release pretty soon.

Bye
Alexander
