Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.6 released
Message-ID: <201003242158.39265.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

The sixth maintenance release of Smb4K 0.10 has been released today. It works 
now with the cifs-utils package (version >= 4.0) that lacks the umount.cifs 
command. Also, two issues with listing shares were fixed and the include files 
are no longer installed.

Please note that this version does not ship with the translations from l10n-
kde4!

ChangeLog:
- Include files are no longer installed.
- Added updated portugese translation. Thanks to Fathi Boudra for sending the
  link and Am?rico Monteiro for the translation.
- Fixed missing of shares that have no comment (closes #16837 and presumably 
  also #3009 and #7949).
- Fixed listing of shares when a "creating lame ..." message appears on stderr
  (closes #16849).
- Backported smb4k_umount from SVN HEAD. Under non-FreeBSD operating systems
  it falls back to use umount directly if umount.cifs could not be found.
- Removed check for mount and umount binaries from
  Smb4KCore::searchPrograms(). smb4k_mount and smb4k_umount will complain if 
  they do not find them.
