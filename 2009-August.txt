Hello Albert,

that would be great! We already planned to contact the KDE developers and ask 
for inclusion into the SVN repository, but due to my lack of time, this has 
not happened yet. So, it's nice that it worked the other way around...

How is the transfer supposed to work? Who should I contact or will you make 
the necessary arrangements on KDE side?

However, I'll be on a business trip until the end of next week, so nothing 
will most likely happen until then unless Massimo has got the time and is 
willing to handle this.

Have a nice weekend!

Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Inclusion of Smb4K into KDE SVN
Message-ID: <200908220956.42854.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Hello!

I'm Alexander Reinholdt, the main developer of Smb4K, an advanced Samba 
browser for KDE.

A few days ago I was approached by Albert Astals Cid from the KDE project who 
suggested to include Smb4K into KDE SVN to get some more exposure to 
developers and users. He pointed me to you to make the necessary arrangements.

We are very keen on having Smb4K included into the KDE repository. So, how 
does the procedure work? Do we have to apply somewhere?

Have a nice weekend!

Alexander
