Subject: [smb4k-devel] KIO slave for Smb4K
Message-ID: <200907010813.02871.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Hello everyone!

Although I did not write for quite some time now, the development of Smb4K is 
not dead. I had some very busy months and I didn't find the time to keep you 
informed. Sorry.

Today I want to announce that the next major version of Smb4K will most likely 
ship with a KIO slave. I have uploaded a pre-alpha version to the CVS 
repository that already can show workgroups/domains, hosts and shares if you 
start with entering "smb4k:/" in the edit line in Dolphin or Konqueror or 
click the "Network"->"Network Neighborhood" entry. Mounting and printing does 
not work yet and entering an URL in the edit line will most likely lead to 
some funny behavior. However, I think the KIO slave is on its way and we can 
replace the Konqueror plugin with it soon. By the way, my attempts to port the 
Konqueror plugin to KDE 4 failed miserably when I tried.

Have a nice day!

Alexander
