Subject: [smb4k-devel] List abandoned due to move to Sourceforge.net
Message-ID: <2030540.5ilGebOaaK@dustpuppy>

Dear list members,

as of today, the mailing list smb4k-devel at lists.berlios.de is abandoned due 
to our move to Sourceforge.net. There is no replacement at Sourceforge for 
this mailing list. But you may want to consider to use our 'General 
Discussions' forum at http://sourceforge.net/p/smb4k/discussion/general/ from 
now on.

Best regards
Alexander
