<PRE>After about one year of development the Smb4K team is proud to announce Smb4K 
0.9.0, the next major version of the advanced network neighborhood browser 
for KDE. It comes with an almost entirely rewritten GUI and many other 
changes under the hood such as the swtich to the KConfig XT configuration 
system, the use of the KParts technology and an improved Konqueror plugin.

Due to the new configuration system, the configuration you used for versions 
prior to 0.9.0 is obsolete. It will be removed on the first start-up of 
version 0.9.0 and you have to reconfigure Smb4K after that. If you want to be 
able to revert to an older version later on, you should back up your 
~/.kde/share/config/smb4krc file before it gets removed.

The compilation of Smb4K 0.9.0 requires KDE 3.3 and Qt 3.3. Please make sure 
you upgrade your system before compiling the source code. KDE 4 is not 
supported.

ChangeLog:
- Cleaned up the code and updated the copyright statements (class 
  descriptions, e-mail address and year).
- Smb4K now uses KConfig XT throughout the whole application. This breaks
  compatibility with older versions of Smb4K.
- Replaced the old configuration dialog with a new one based on KConfigDialog
  to take advantange of the KConfig XT infrastructure. It is a KDE module
  library: libsmb4kconfigdialog.
- Added some configuration options:
  + The '-S &lt;arg&gt;' (signing state) and '-P' (use machine account) arguments of
    smbclient are now supported.
  + Added several advanced mount.cifs options and the ability to pass custom
    options to mount.cifs (closes #10249). You will need Linux kernel 
    &gt;= 2.6.15 to take advantage of most of them.
  + Added the ability to remove all options at once in the &quot;Custom&quot; tab of the
    Samba configuration page.
- Changed some configuration options:
  + The hidden files and directories are not displayed in the preview dialog 
    by default.
  + Rsync's '--existing' and '--ignore-existing' option can be active at the
    same time.
  + The default UID and GID are now those of the user.
- Removed obsolete Smb4KUser class.
- Implemented validity checks into the core container classes, so that only 
  IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses are used (closes #11470).
- Modified Smb4KGlobal namespace:
  + Removed Smb4KGlobal::kernelVersion() function.
  + Removed Smb4KGlobal::systemName() function.
  + Removed Smb4KGlobal::config() function.
  + Removed Smb4KGlobal::getUMASK().
- Removed Smb4KHomesShareHandler::convert() function.
- Revised Smb4KCore class:
  + Rewrote Smb4KCore::searchPrograms().
  + Removed Smb4KCore::smb4k_core() static pointer and replaced it with a 
    better approach (Smb4KCore::self() and static pointers to the core 
    classes).
  + Added Smb4KCore::init() function, that initializes the core, i.e. starts 
    the scanning of the network and the import and remounting of shares.
- Improved Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler class:
  + The constructor does not take a KConfig object anymore.
  + The client charset and server codepage will be auto-detected if the 'unix
    charset' and 'dos charset' options are present in smb.conf, respectively
    (closes #10805).
- Modified Smb4KShare class:
  + Moved to KUser and KUserGroup to retrieve information about the user and 
    the group of the mounted share. This sets the minimum requirement to KDE 
    3.3.
  + Added Smb4KShare::setUID() and Smb4KShare::setGID() functions.
  + Smb4KShare::equals() now takes a constant reference instead of a pointer.
- Improved Smb4KMounter class:
  + Removed legacy code from mountRecent() function and renamed it to 
    remount().
  + Renamed Smb4KMounter::State::MountRecent to Smb4KMounter::State::Remount.
  + Smb4KMounter::findShareByName() now returns a list of all mounts of the
    specified share that are present on the system. This way the checks for
    mounted shares etc. could be improved.
  + Rewrote Smb4KMounter::mount() function.
  + Cleaned up Smb4KMounter::unmount() and improved the remaining checks.
  + Removed check for correct Linux kernel if the &quot;Force Unmounting&quot; feature 
    is used. The operating system will throw an error if the wrong kernel is 
    used.
  + Added a new function Smb4KMounter::checkAccessibilty( Smb4KShare *share ).
    It replaces code in Smb4KMounter::import() and 
    Smb4KMounter::processMount() and simplifies maintenance.
  + The &quot;bad user name&quot; and &quot;bad group name&quot; messages that are returned by
    mount.cifs if a bad UID/GID are provided are recognized as errors.
  + Improved Smb4KMounter::isMounted(). It takes now a boolean as second 
    argument that determines whether all or only user mounts should be 
    considered.
- Modified Smb4KScanner class:
  + Removed preview code from class.
  + Improved code for custom search requests.
  + Renamed Smb4KScanner::addHost() function to Smb4KScanner::insertHost() and
    improved it.
  + Added hostAdded() signal that is emitted when a single host has been added
    via the insertHost() function to the list of known hosts.
- Moved Smb4KMounterPrivate and Smb4KScannerPrivate classes to own files. Now
  the users can use the --enable-final configure option without problems.
- Introduced Smb4KPreviewer core class that takes care of previews of remote
  shares.
- Rewrote Smb4KPreviewItem class and moved it into own files.
- Introduced new Smb4KSynchronizationInfo container class.
- Modified Smb4KSynchronizer class:
  + Replaced the &quot;--devices&quot; option by the &quot;--devices --specials&quot; options, so
    that also fifos, etc. can be preserved.
  + Replaced the &quot;--remove-sent-files&quot; option by &quot;--remove-source-files&quot;. This
    makes rsync 2.6.9 a requirement, if you want to take advantage of this
    option.
  + Removed the URL requester and the progress dialog.
  + Added new signals: progress() and finished().
  + Make use of the new Smb4KSynchronizationInfo container class.
  + A new synchronization request won't be taken if one is already processed.
- Modified Smb4KPasswordHandler class:
  + Removed import() function which imported authentication data from old
    password file (versions prior to Smb4K 0.6.0).
  + The constructor does not take a KConfig object anymore.
  + The descriptive text in the askpass dialog now distinguishes between a
    server and a share.
- Did a major revision of Smb4KFileIO class:
  + Removed Smb4KFileIO::getUsers().
  + Removed Smb4KFileIO::writeSuperUserEntries().
  + Removed Smb4KFileIO::removeSuperUserEntries().
  + Removed Smb4KFileIO::processOutput().
  + Removed obsolete compatibility code.
  + Introduced Smb4KFileIO::writeSudoers().
  + Introduced Smb4KFileIO::writeSuperTab().
  + Introduced Smb4KFileIO::processSudoers().
  + Introduced Smb4KFileIO::processSuperTab().
  + The env_keep list will not be replaced, but PASSWD and USER are appended
    to it.
- Modified definitions in smb4kdefs.h. For changes see the file itself.
- Improved Smb4KBookmark class:
  + Added ability to define an alternative label that can be used to identify
    the bookmark in a custom way.
  + Added constructor that takes a Smb4KHostItem object.
- Improved Smb4KBookmarkHandler class:
  + Implemented support for the new label feature.
  + Replaced findBookmark() by findBookmarkByName() and findBookmarkByLabel()
    functions.
  + Rewrote addBookmark() function.
- Smb4KPrint now supports the &quot;application/x-shellscript&quot; mime type.
- Unified API of the network item classes.
- Bumped version of the core library to 2.0.0.
- Rewrote main window:
  + Smb4KApp now inherits KParts::DockMainWindow.
  + Removed labels that gave information about the WINS server and the look-up
    method.
  + Made the status bar messages a bit more informative.
- Redesigned shares icon view:
  + Removed Smb4KShareWidget, Smb4KShareWidgetItem, Smb4KShareActionMenu, and
    Smb4KShareTooltip classes.
  + Introduced new classes: Smb4KSharesIconView, Smb4KSharesIconViewItem,
    Smb4KSharesIconViewPart, and Smb4KSharesIconViewToolTip.
  + The shares iconview is now a KParts KDE module: libsmb4ksharesiconview.
  + Removed the fake list view feature.
  + Added ability to open a mounted share with Konsole. This is useful for
    people who need to execute shell scripts on the share.
- Added new shares list view:
  + The features of the new list view are similar to the ones of the icon 
    view.
  + The new list view consists of the classes: Smb4KSharesListViewPart,
    Smb4KSharesListView, Smb4KSharesListViewItem and 
    Smb4KSharesListViewToolTip.
- Redesigned network browser:
  + Removed Smb4KBrowserWidget, Smb4KBrowserWidgetItem, 
    Smb4KBrowserActionMenu, and Smb4KNetworkItemTooltip classes.
  + Introduced new classes: Smb4KNetworkBrowser, Smb4KNetworkBrowserItem,
    Smb4KNetworkBrowserPart and Smb4KNetworkBrowserToolTip.
  + The network browser is now a KParts KDE module: libsmb4knetworkbrowser.
- Redesigned search dialog:
  + Applied a major revision to the Smb4KSearchDialog class. Among other 
    things, the widget that shows the search results is now a KListView.
  + Introduced new Smb4KSearchDialogItem class for easier handling of the 
    items in the list view.
  + Introduced Smb4KSearchDialogPart class that manages the communication with
    the core and the rest of the application.
  + The search dialog is now a KParts KDE module: libsmb4ksearchdialog. (An rc
    file is not provided because it's not needed.)
- Introduced a new synchronization dialog (Smb4KSynchronizationDialog) where 
  the old URL requester and the progress dialog from Smb4KSynchronizer were 
  merged.
- Redesigned the print dialog.
- Revised the preview dialog. It now uses the new Smb4KPreviewer class and the
  reworked Smb4KPreviewItem class.
