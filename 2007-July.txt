Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.8.4 released
Message-ID: <200707141918.23296.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

The Smb4K team released version 0.8.4 of the advanced Samba browser for KDE 
today.

Overview: This release mainly features backported bug fixes from CVS HEAD, but 
also provides an updated Turkish and reintroduces the Polish translation. The 
main improvements are that printing on remote printer shares works again and 
that the DCOP-related hanging of Smb4K on (KDE) start-up has been eliminated. 
The list of all changes can be found below.

ChangeLog:
- Reintroduced Polish translation provided by Jerzy Trzeciak.
- Updated Turkish translation and improved smb4k_add.desktop file. Thanks go
  to Serdar Soytetir for providing the patches.
- Fixed missing functionality of the --ignore-existing argument of rsync.
- Fixed 'net rap server domain' command that is incompatible with Samba
  3.0.25 (and later?).
- Fixed Smb4KPasswordHandler::readAuth() that returned a pointer that was
  freed when the function exited.
- Fixed broken Smb4KPrint::print() function.
- Fixed a bug in the preview dialog that led to the hanging of the whole
  application.
- Fixed DCOP-related hanging of Smb4K during KDE startup (closes #11189):
  + Added 'X-DCOP-ServiceType=Unique' entry to smb4k.desktop file.
  + Implemented KUniqueApplication::start() in main.cpp.
- Fixed a potential memory leak in the bookmark editor.

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Status of the next major release
Message-ID: <200707200802.34511.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone,

I have been busy bringing Smb4K into shape for the next major release and I'm 
pleased to announce that no new features will be implemented until the 
release of the next major version: 0.9.0. This means that e.g. the Konqueror 
plugin can be revised now. The messages are *not* frozen yet, because I still 
have to implement several "What's this?" texts. I will announce their freeze 
as soon as possible. However, you can already start translating because most 
of the strings that are already there won't change anymore.

Since Smb4K has undergone the biggest overhaul since the beginning of the 
project, I plan to release alpha and beta version as well as release 
candidates later this year when the code compiles completely again. I haven't 
thought about a schedule yet. I'll announce it later.

Have a nice day.

Bye
Alexander
