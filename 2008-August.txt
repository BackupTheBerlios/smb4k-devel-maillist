Subject: [smb4k-devel] Last minute changes and updated release schedule
Message-ID: <200808031557.56048.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Hello everyone,

during my final checks, I discovered several issues that made it necessary to 
modify the code. Unfortunately, also messages are affected, and I apologize to 
all translators for that.

These issues were:

(1) The code that wrote to the sudoers file turned out to still not work 
reliably. So, I coded a new utility program called smb4k_sudowriter which will 
now add or remove users to/from the sudoers file, without corrupting it. Due 
to the new program smb4k_cat and smb4k_mv were removed because they are not 
needed anymore.

(2) The error dialogs were barely readable, because they were not properly 
resized. Additionally, they were not properly formated. I hope, by the changes 
I applied, these issues are now fixed.

Because of these last minute changes I think it is necessary to postpone the 
release of Smb4K 0.10.0 for one or two weeks and release a release candidate 
next weekend instead. The new schedule is, thus, as follows:

2008-08-10: Release of Smb4K 0.10.0rc
2008-08-17: Release of Smb4K 0.10.0 (if no show stoppers occur)

Have a nice weekend!

Best regards
Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Status of Smb4K 0.10.0
Message-ID: <1KXWVP-22SIRk0@fwd31.aul.t-online.de>

Hello everyone,

maybe you wonder, why Smb4K 0.10.0 has not been released yet. The reason
is that in the last two weeks I was very busy at work, so I could not
give Smb4K as much attention as I planned. Also, some bugs tuned up that
needed to be fixed before the release. Last weekend I could fix several
issues and now only minor problems are still present that I should be
able to fix within this week. So, I hope that we can release Smb4K
around next weekend.

Best regards
Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.9.7 released
Message-ID: <200808292011.42922.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

While the release of Smb4K 0.10.0 is only hours away, we bring you an update 
to the current stable 0.9 branch. Version 0.9.7 fixes a bug in the password 
handler code and several problems that occur when KDE 4.x is used. Also, the 
Swedish translation has been updated.

ChangeLog:
- Backported rewritten Smb4KCore::searchPrograms() function that garantees
  that the correct utility programs are found and we do not run into
  trouble with another Smb4K installation on the system (i.e. in KDE 4).
- Fixed error message box in Smb4KConfigDialog::checkSettings().
- Fixed Smb4KPasswordHandler::writeAuth(). Incorrect login data is now
  properly overwritten in no-wallet mode.
- Backported improved Smb4KAuthInfo class.
- Added hicolor fall back icons. They are actually copies of the crystal
  ones.
- Updated Swedish translation. Thanks go to Leslie Jensen for the update.

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.0 released
Message-ID: <200808301958.54643.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

Today, we released version 0.10.0 of Smb4K, the advanced network neighborhood 
browser for KDE. It comes with many simplifications, improvements and 
changes: The support of the deprecated SMBFS file system under Linux and the 
support of the super program have been removed, the graphical user interface 
was redesigned and most of the code of the core library rewritten. This 
version also fixes one of the most aggrevating bugs that users experienced 
when using Smb4K: the broken sudoers file problem.

With this version, Smb4K has become a KDE 4 only application that uses the 
cmake build system. For information how to configure Smb4K and what is needed 
to compile it, you can have a look at [1].

Since Konqueror is not the default file manager in KDE 4 anymore, we decided 
to not port the Konqueror plugin for now. If it will be ported one day will 
be decided later. If you want to influence our decision, please fill you the 
(little bit outdated) survey [2].

ChangeLog:
- Ported Smb4K to KDE4 only.
- Moved the build system to cmake.
- Applied lots of small optimizations.
- Fixed many GCC 4.3 related warnings.
- Removed support for IRIX and Solaris. If you want to have it back, please
  join the Smb4K project and help with development.
- Removed Franck Babin from the list of authors because Smb4K does not
  contains any code from him anymore.
- Did a major rewrite of all KProcess related functions in the core classes,
  because the API of the KProcess class changed.

  - Moved error codes from smb4kdefs.h to here.

    instead.

    automatically.

  nmblookup).
- Revised Smb4KCore class:
  + The open() convenience function has been revised.
  + Rewrote searchPrograms() function so that only those utility programs are
    found that belong to the current release and we do not run into problems
    with parallel KDE 3 installations of Smb4K.
- Revised Smb4KHomesSharesHandler class:
  + The user names for the homes shares are now saved to an XML file. The old
    data will be imported automatically.

  + Redesigned the "Custom Settings" tab on the "Samba" configuration page.
  + Improved writing/removing of super user entries.

    and GID are now read-only and you have to choose the new values from a
    context menu.

  + Items are expanded after the search process ended and not before.
  + Removed several obsolete functions from Smb4KNetworkBrowserItem class.

    signals. The tool tip now emits similar signals.

    Smb4KNetworkBrowser::leaveEvent() to keep track of the mouse.
  + Added Smb4KNetworkBrowser::mouseInside() and
    Smb4KNetworkBrowser::mouseOutside() signals that are emitted when the 
    mouse entered and left the network browser, respectively.
  + The behavior of the rescan action changed slightly. If you move the mouse
    outside the widget, the rescan will be affected by the selected item and 
    not by the fact that the mouse is outside.
  + Revised and improved the tool tip management.
  + Removed Smb4KNetworkBrowser::blockToolTips(), because it is not needed
    anymore.

- Revised search dialog:
  + Adjusted search dialog to the requirements of the new search core class.
    It now displays servers and shares.

  + The list widget is automatically cleared when a new search was started.
  + Moved all slots from Smb4KSearchDialog to Smb4KSearchDialogPart class.
  + The Smb4KSearchDialogItem::setupItem() function replaces the previous
    Smb4KSearchDialogItem::setIcon(), because it collided with
    KListWidget::setIcon().
- Revised shares view:
  + Merged list view and icon view into one KPart (Smb4KSharesViewPart).
  + Added Smb4KSharesViewItemData container class that carries the information
    needed by the items and the tool tips.
  + The units used to display the disk usage were corrected. Smb4K has
    always shown values with radix 2, so we have to use KiB, MiB, GiB, ...
  + The list view and the tool tips now show the owner and group also with
    the CIFS file system.
  + Added ability to move columns and save their positions when the list view
    is used.
  + With foreign shares the unmount actions are only enabled when the user is
    allowed to unmount those (see configuration dialog).
  + Removed usage bar from the list view, since with the methods available for
    the QTreeWidgetItem class this either cannot be achieved (?) or looks very
    ugly. The usage in percent is still shown.
  + Drag and Drop support is now always enabled. You can drop URLs onto items
    and drag a share outside Smb4K.
- Rewrote main window:
  + Smb4KMainWindow replaces Smb4KApp class.
  + The KParts are now organized in tabs by default.
  + The main tool bar has been extended, but it is hidden by default. The user
    can reach its functions through the menu.
- Modified utility programs:
  + Introduced smb4k_sudowriter utility program that writes to the sudoers 
    file. This finally fixes the corrupted-sudoers-file issues that were 
    reported by several users.
  + Removed smb4k_cat utility program because its not needed anymore.
  + Removed smb4k_mv utility program because its not needed anymore.
- Updated handbook.

The new version can be downloaded from [3].
