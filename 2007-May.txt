Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.8.2 released
Message-ID: <200705011000.23471.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

This is the second maintenance release of Smb4K 0.8 that we released today. It 
provides a workaround for a bug that led to shares being remounted with UID=0 
and GID=0 when the CIFS file system was used. Besides, a few cosmetic changes 
and a bug fix were applied to the utility programs. The handbook was updated.

ChangeLog:
- Modified utility programs:
  + Fixed the "No mode was specified" bug in smb4k_mount/smb4k_umount and
    related issues in the other utility programs.
  + Modified the help screens of the utility programs with respect to clarity
    and better readability.
  + Warnings are shown if deprecated arguments are used.
  + Increased all versions by 0.1.
- Worked around a bug where shares where remounted with UID=0 and GID=0 when
  using the CIFS file system.
- Improved the 'Trouble Shooting' section of the handbook and bumped its 
  version to 1.1.2.

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.8.3 released
Message-ID: <200705021912.34083.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Only hours after Smb4K 0.8.2 was released, it was noticed that the unmount 
command lines had not been adjusted to the new versions of the utility 
programs and that, hence, Smb4K complained everytime a share was unmounted. 
This issue has been fixed in this version.

ChangeLog:
- Fixed command line in Smb4KMounter:unmount() that provoked smb4k_umount 
  to complain about a deprecated argument.
- Applied Turkish translation patch provided by Ismail Donmez.

Subject: [smb4k-devel] First commits of new code to HEAD
Message-ID: <200705120857.59654.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone,

I know I haven't written anything for quite some time to this mailing list and 
I'm sorry. My work kept me busy over the last weeks and in the spare time I 
implemened new features into Smb4K. So, today, I want to announce that I will 
start to commit the changes I already did to the code base this weekend. 
Since there are so many changes and I plan not to commit everything in one go 
but bit by bit, there will be times the code won't compile.

One of the first things I'll commit will be the new, work-in-progress 
translations. If you like, you can start translating them right away.

Have a nice weekend!

Bye
Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-devel] CVS HEAD up-to-date
Message-ID: <200705202206.00804.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone,

the CVS HEAD repository is now up-to-date. Today I committed the last local 
modifications.

Here are some remarks concerning changes in the code:

(1) The smb4k/widgets/ subdirectory is obsolete. All class files that are 
still present in there will vanish sooner or later. Do not link to 
libsmb4kwidgets library anymore.

(2) Smb4K now uses KConfig XT and thus making the Smb4KGlobal::config() object 
obsolete. Please use the Smb4KSettings static functions.

(3) The widgets of the main window have moved to KParts and you can load the 
respective libraries using KLibLoader. See Smb4KApp class for an example.

(4) The configuration dialog can also be loaded with KLibLoader. See Smb4KApp 
for an example.

(5) To access the core objects now use the static pointers Smb4KCore::self(), 
Smb4KCore::scanner(), Smb4KCore::mounter(), Smb4KCore::synchronizer(), etc.

(6) The popup menus that were organized in separate classes in previous 
version of Smb4K are now managed by the KParts. If modifications are needed 
to integrate them into e.g. the Konqueror plugin, please let me know.

OK, that is it for now. If you have any trouble getting your code working, 
please contact me.

Have a nice evening!

Bye
Alexander
