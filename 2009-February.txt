Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.2 released
Message-ID: <200902221200.12521.alexander.reinholdt@t-online.de>

The second maintenance release of Smb4K 0.10 has been released today. It fixes 
problems that occurred with previous releases when Samba 3.3 was used and 
comes with a new wallet manager that should fix the "hangs on KDE start-up" 
bug that was experienced by several users. Under FreeBSD the file system port 
has been removed, because it is identical to the SMB port. Several minor bugs 
have been eliminated and the version of the core library was bumped to 3.1.0.

ChangeLog:
- Revised Smb4KMounter class:
  + Under Linux, the import function does not insert a share with SMBFS
    file system twice anymore.
  + Prevent the mounter from trying to do something before the application
    has completely started up.
  + Replaced the file system port with the SMB port under FreeBSD.
- Revised Smb4KScanner class:
  + Fixed wrong error handling in Smb4KScanner::processWorkgroupMembers()
    when an authentication error occurred.
- Revised Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler:
  + Fixed "Invalid command:" bugs with Samba 3.3 (closes #15276).
  + Replaced all occurences of the file system port by the SMB port.
- Added missing function declaration of Smb4KPrintInfo::setShareItem().
- Revised Smb4KCore class:
  + Fixed wrong connection to the previewer.
- Fixed potentially missing comma at the end of the string that is passed
  by Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler::mountOptions() under Linux.
- Backported the new wallet manager from CVS (closes #14703).
- Backported improved Smb4KAuthInfo class.
- Backported Smb4KHomesSharesHandler::setHomesUsers( Smb4KAuthInfo * ).
- Bumped version of core library to 3.1.0.
- Reintroduced editing of the IP address in the bookmark editor.
- Fixed removing of 'homes' users list from the "Specify User" dialog.
- Backported wallet usage indicator in the main window.
- Modified the Samba configuration page:
  + Fixed a crash in the "Custom Options" tab.
  + Removed the file system port entry under FreeBSD.
