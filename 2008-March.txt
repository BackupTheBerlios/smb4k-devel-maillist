Subject: [smb4k-devel] Status of the KDE 4 port
Message-ID: <200803021718.41834.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone!

Here is another short update on the status of the KDE 4 port of Smb4K. 

Today I finished the initial porting of the network browser. It complies and 
can already be loaded successfully into the main window. However, first tests 
have shown that it is still quite buggy and that there is a substantial 
amount of work needed to bring it into shape.

The core classes have seen even more changes since my last report. The mounter 
is getting a better remount behavior at the moment and the password handler 
now uses the new authentication data format that has also been backported to 
the 0.9 branch.

Overall much old cruft has been removed and I hope that this will eventually 
speed up the application.

Help in porting the application and fixing bugs is much appreciated.

Best regards
Alexander
