<PRE>Hello everyone,

I have been busy bringing Smb4K into shape for the next major release and I'm 
pleased to announce that no new features will be implemented until the 
release of the next major version: 0.9.0. This means that e.g. the Konqueror 
plugin can be revised now. The messages are *not* frozen yet, because I still 
have to implement several &quot;What's this?&quot; texts. I will announce their freeze 
as soon as possible. However, you can already start translating because most 
of the strings that are already there won't change anymore.

Since Smb4K has undergone the biggest overhaul since the beginning of the 
project, I plan to release alpha and beta version as well as release 
candidates later this year when the code compiles completely again. I haven't 
thought about a schedule yet. I'll announce it later.

Have a nice day.

Bye
Alexander
