Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.74 (1.0.0 beta5) released
Message-ID: <3292193.cYnWdGb3CF@dustpuppy>

In this fifth beta version the system tray widget has seen another major 
revision. Additionally, the way how forced unmounts are handled was changed 
(Linux only), the "Add Bookmark" action was added to the main tool bar, and 
shares owned by other users are now marked with a red flag. Further work on 
the handbook has been done.
