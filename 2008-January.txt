Subject: [smb4k-devel] Support for Smb4K 0.6.10 and 0.7.5 terminated
Message-ID: <200801061810.39326.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Today the support for Smb4K's legacy versions 0.6.10 and 0.7.5 has officially 
been terminated. All files have been removed from our project's download 
site. They are still available from our FTP site, though.

We want to encourage all users who still use these versions to update to 
either Smb4K 0.8.7 (KDE 3.2 and above) or to Smb4K 0.9.1 (KDE 3.3 and above).

For the Smb4K team

KioFuse allows all apps (Firefox, OpenOffice, bash scripts, etc) to
access KIO-based files through the traditional POSIX API:

http://techbase.kde.org/index.php?title=Projects/KioFuse
http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/playground/libs/kiofuse/

There are issues that still need to be resolved in KioFuse, notably
integrating it into the KNetAttach GUI. For a full list, please see
the TODO file.

Now for some general thoughts on KIO:

KIO's API is great, but a drawback is that it's only accessible to the
main thread (GUI thread if the app has a GUI). Some KDE developers
have pointed to other deficiencies in KIO that have dissuaded them
from working on existing IO slaves. For example, KFTP
(http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=15343) uses its own
abstraction for FTP and SFTP access instead of the FTP and SFTP KIO
slaves. KFTP's author explains his reasoning here:

http://dot.kde.org/1196818371/1196822000/1196849333/

SMB4K (http://smb4k.berlios.de) has similarly chosen to forgo the SMB
KIO slave. 

I think we should include these KDE developers in the discussion about
how they would like the KIO API to be changed so that it fits the
needs of their users. Before we attempt cross-desktop integration, it
might be easier to first get all KDE devs using and improving the same
codebase.

Best regards,
Vlad

Nice.  I look forward to the issues getting resolved.

True, although if they want the API to be changed, they may be about 2 years 
too late, unless they can live with only additions...
