<PRE>Hello everyone,

during my final checks, I discovered several issues that made it necessary to 
modify the code. Unfortunately, also messages are affected, and I apologize to 
all translators for that.

These issues were:

(1) The code that wrote to the sudoers file turned out to still not work 
reliably. So, I coded a new utility program called smb4k_sudowriter which will 
now add or remove users to/from the sudoers file, without corrupting it. Due 
to the new program smb4k_cat and smb4k_mv were removed because they are not 
needed anymore.

(2) The error dialogs were barely readable, because they were not properly 
resized. Additionally, they were not properly formated. I hope, by the changes 
I applied, these issues are now fixed.

Because of these last minute changes I think it is necessary to postpone the 
release of Smb4K 0.10.0 for one or two weeks and release a release candidate 
next weekend instead. The new schedule is, thus, as follows:

2008-08-10: Release of Smb4K 0.10.0rc
2008-08-17: Release of Smb4K 0.10.0 (if no show stoppers occur)

Have a nice weekend!

Best regards
Alexander
