<PRE>Today, we released version 0.10.0 of Smb4K, the advanced network neighborhood 
browser for KDE. It comes with many simplifications, improvements and 
changes: The support of the deprecated SMBFS file system under Linux and the 
support of the super program have been removed, the graphical user interface 
was redesigned and most of the code of the core library rewritten. This 
version also fixes one of the most aggrevating bugs that users experienced 
when using Smb4K: the broken sudoers file problem.

With this version, Smb4K has become a KDE 4 only application that uses the 
cmake build system. For information how to configure Smb4K and what is needed 
to compile it, you can have a look at [1].

Since Konqueror is not the default file manager in KDE 4 anymore, we decided 
to not port the Konqueror plugin for now. If it will be ported one day will 
be decided later. If you want to influence our decision, please fill you the 
(little bit outdated) survey [2].

ChangeLog:
- Ported Smb4K to KDE4 only.
- Moved the build system to cmake.
- Applied lots of small optimizations.
- Fixed many GCC 4.3 related warnings.
- Removed support for IRIX and Solaris. If you want to have it back, please
  join the Smb4K project and help with development.
- Removed Franck Babin from the list of authors because Smb4K does not
  contains any code from him anymore.
- Did a major rewrite of all KProcess related functions in the core classes,
  because the API of the KProcess class changed.
- Replaced Smb4KError by Smb4KCoreMessage class:
  - Moved error codes from smb4kdefs.h to here.
  - Added several error codes.
  - Removed unused error codes.
- Modified Smb4KSettings class:
  + Renamed several configuration entries. Transition will be seamless due to
    automatic updating.
  + Removed support for deprecated SMBFS file system (Linux).
  + Added port for the file system. Its default value is 445 (CIFS).
- Modified Smb4KGlobal class:
  + Removed Smb4KGlobal::timer(). It is replaced by per-class solutions.
  + Removed Smb4KHomesShareHandler class. Use Smb4KHomesSharesHandler::self()
    instead.
  + Removed Smb4KPasswordHandler class. Use Smb4KPasswordHandler::self()
    instead.
  + Removed Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler class. Use 
    Smb4KSambaOptionsHandler::self() instead.

    workgroups.
  + Added hostsList() function that returns the list of all discovered hosts.
  + Added mountedSharesList() function that returns the list of all discovered
    mounted shares.

    Smb4KBookmarkHandler::findBookmarkByUNC().

  + Removed several functions.
  + Introduced shareItem() function. Through it you can access information

  + The constructor now only takes a Smb4KShare object. You have to set the 
    path to the file and the number of copies by the other functions provided 
    by the class.

    Smb4KShare constructor.

    until the server becomes available (closes #13217).
  + Improved remounting. The IP address and the workgroup are now used.
  + Removed support for the suid program super.

  + Added setHasCustomOptions() function.

  + There are three netOptions() functions, each taking different arguments.
  + Added sharesToRemount() function that only returns information for those
    shares that are to be remounted.

    list.
  + The options handler now reads and writes the host's IP address and 
    workgroup as well.
  + The options are now saved to an XML file. The old data will be imported
    automatically.
  + Removed support for the deprecated SMBFS file system (Linux).
- Revised Smb4KScanner class:
  + The constructor now takes a QObject as only argument. Smb4KScanner makes 
    now use of the new global workgroups and hosts lists.
  + The getShares() function now takes a Smb4KHostItem object.
  + The getWorkgroupMembers() function now takes a Smb4KWorkgroupItem object.

  + Added a queue where the print jobs are stored as long as they are 
    processed.
  + Added startTimer(), killTimer(), timerEvent() combo to process the 
    incoming print requests.
  + Removed slotRetry() because it was obsolete.
- Introduced new Smb4KIPAddressScanner class, that operates on the global host
  list and looks up the IP address for each host.
- Introduced Smb4KSearch class, that looks up the search strings the user
  provided through the search dialog. This now also includes remote shares. 
  The search program to use will determined automatically (smbtree or 
  nmblookup).
- Revised Smb4KCore class:
  + The open() convenience function has been revised.
  + Rewrote searchPrograms() function so that only those utility programs are
    found that belong to the current release and we do not run into problems
    with parallel KDE 3 installations of Smb4K.
- Revised Smb4KHomesSharesHandler class:
  + The user names for the homes shares are now saved to an XML file. The old
    data will be imported automatically.

  + Redesigned the &quot;Custom Settings&quot; tab on the &quot;Samba&quot; configuration page.
  + Improved writing/removing of super user entries.
  + The (global) UID and GID input widgets were changed. The displayed UID
    and GID are now read-only and you have to choose the new values from a
    context menu.

  + Items are expanded after the search process ended and not before.
  + Removed several obsolete functions from Smb4KNetworkBrowserItem class.
  + Removed Smb4KNetworkBrowser::closeToolTip() and ::aboutToShowToolTip()
    signals. The tool tip now emits similar signals.

    Smb4KNetworkBrowser::leaveEvent() to keep track of the mouse.
  + Added Smb4KNetworkBrowser::mouseInside() and
    Smb4KNetworkBrowser::mouseOutside() signals that are emitted when the 
    mouse entered and left the network browser, respectively.
  + The behavior of the rescan action changed slightly. If you move the mouse
    outside the widget, the rescan will be affected by the selected item and 
    not by the fact that the mouse is outside.
  + Revised and improved the tool tip management.
  + Removed Smb4KNetworkBrowser::blockToolTips(), because it is not needed
    anymore.
  + Added several functions to Smb4KNetworkBrowser to make it comply with
    KDE's global settings.
  + Added ability to move columns and save their positions.
- Revised search dialog:
  + Adjusted search dialog to the requirements of the new search core class.
    It now displays servers and shares.
  + Added ability to mount shares.
  + Removed push buttons next to the combo box from the widget.

  + The list widget is automatically cleared when a new search was started.
  + Moved all slots from Smb4KSearchDialog to Smb4KSearchDialogPart class.
  + The Smb4KSearchDialogItem::setupItem() function replaces the previous
    Smb4KSearchDialogItem::setIcon(), because it collided with
    KListWidget::setIcon().
- Revised shares view:
  + Merged list view and icon view into one KPart (Smb4KSharesViewPart).
  + Added Smb4KSharesViewItemData container class that carries the information
    needed by the items and the tool tips.
  + The units used to display the disk usage were corrected. Smb4K has
    always shown values with radix 2, so we have to use KiB, MiB, GiB, ...
  + The list view and the tool tips now show the owner and group also with
    the CIFS file system.
  + Added ability to move columns and save their positions when the list view
    is used.
  + With foreign shares the unmount actions are only enabled when the user is
    allowed to unmount those (see configuration dialog).
  + Removed usage bar from the list view, since with the methods available for
    the QTreeWidgetItem class this either cannot be achieved (?) or looks very
    ugly. The usage in percent is still shown.
  + Drag and Drop support is now always enabled. You can drop URLs onto items
    and drag a share outside Smb4K.
- Rewrote main window:
  + Smb4KMainWindow replaces Smb4KApp class.
  + The KParts are now organized in tabs by default.
  + The main tool bar has been extended, but it is hidden by default. The user
    can reach its functions through the menu.
- Modified utility programs:
  + Introduced smb4k_sudowriter utility program that writes to the sudoers 
    file. This finally fixes the corrupted-sudoers-file issues that were 
    reported by several users.
  + Removed smb4k_cat utility program because its not needed anymore.
  + Removed smb4k_mv utility program because its not needed anymore.
- Updated handbook.

The new version can be downloaded from [3].
