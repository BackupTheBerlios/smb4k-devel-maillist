Subject: [smb4k-devel] New caption for Smb4K
Message-ID: <200706131910.29281.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone!

Smb4K has evolved quite a bit since I came up with the caption "Smb4K - The 
SMB/CIFS Browser for KDE" and I think it does not fit anymore. There are 
currently two options I consider and I need some help with the decision:

(1) Drop the caption altogether. The main window would only show "Smb4K".

(2) Insert a new caption. There are currently two drafts, but I'm happy with 
none of them:
    
* Smb4K - The Advanced Samba Tool for KDE

* Smb4K - The Advanced Network Neighborhood Browser for KDE

The first one might indicate that this tool was created by the Samba team, 
which it wasn't, and the second is too long. Does anyone have a better idea? 
And: Which option would you choose?

Bye
Alexander
