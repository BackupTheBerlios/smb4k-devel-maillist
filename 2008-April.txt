Subject: [smb4k-devel] [PATCH] install config module as module
Message-ID: <200804031808.00289.mueller@kde.org>


Hi, 

smb4k currently installs the config module as a library, instead of a module. 
the patch below corrects that. 


Greetings,
Dirk

Hello everyone,

before I give you an update on the current development status of Smb4K, I am 
pleased to welcome Leslie Jensen in our project, who will work on the Swedish 
translation.

KDE 4 port:

The port to KDE 4 slowly takes form. I just finished the porting of the search 
dialog and of the network browser. Especially the search dialog has seen a 
major improvement. It now has a menu and a tool bar as well as a popup menu. 
This way it is easier to use. I would like to encourage you to test the code 
and give me some feedback concerning the search dialog but also concerning 
the rest of the application.

The next tasks are to port the shares view(s) and get the main window into 
shape for a first alpha release. When the alpha release will happen, I cannot 
tell at the moment.

Stable branch (KDE 3):

Besides the development of the KDE 4 port I also prepared a new maintenance 
release for the 0.9 branch. I plan to release version 0.9.4 next weekend. It 
fixes two authentication related issues and bugs in the scanner and mounter. 
Additionally I changed some strings and thus I would like to ask our 
translators, to update their translations. Updates can be committed to CVS 
until Saturday. I will generate the tarball of the new version on Sunday.

That's it for now. Have a nice weekend.

Bye
Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.9.4 released
Message-ID: <200804271802.27406.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Smb4K 0.9.4 comes with fixes for minor bugs in the scanner, the mounter, the 
network browser, the configuration dialog, and the shares views. Most of the 
work went into revising the password handler: We successfully tracked down 
and finally eliminated the "Smb4K hangs on KDE start-up" issue. Additionally, 
the wallet support won't be disabled completely when the authentication 
fails, but only for the current session.

ChangeLog:
- Smb4KGlobal::timer() is now deprecated.
- The core classes now use QObject::timerEvent() instead of a connection
  to Smb4KGlobal::timer().
- Smb4K will try to launch the wallet manager before it opens the wallet.
  This should prevent it from hanging on start-up (closes #12707).
- If the digital wallet could not be opened, KWallet support won't be
  disabled completely but only for the current session.
- Fixed blocking of tooltips in the network browser.
- Fixed invalid check in the network browser's tool tip code.
- Simplified code in smb4k_cat. Bumped version to 0.8.
- Fixed disabled configuration dialog when another user edited the same
  system file.
- Fixed wrong path when the strings "cifs" or "smbfs" were part of the
  mount point name (closes #13342).
- Fixed unrecognized authentication error when querying the workgroup
  master browser for the workgroup members (closes #12830).
- Fixed flickering of items in the shares views.
- Applied patch by Dirk Mueller that installs the configuration dialog as
  KDE module.

The source code of the new version can be downloaded from our project page at 
http://smb4k.berlios.de/download.html or directly from 
http://prdownload.berlios.de/smb4k/smb4k-0.9.4.tar.bz2.
