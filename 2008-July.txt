Subject: [smb4k-devel] SMBFS support & Konqueror plugin
Message-ID: <200807021943.53426.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone,

there are two things I would like to report about the development of Smb4K 
0.10.0:

1) With the commit yesterday, the support for the deprecated SMBFS file system 
has been terminated and the respective code removed. Since all distributions 
that ship KDE 4 also come with a recent mount.cifs and umount.cifs that are 
capable of mounting also W9x shares, there is no need to still maintain SMBFS.

2) Massimo and I discussed the future of the Konqueror plugin and we decided 
to defer the decision about what will happen with it. As long as no decision 
has been made, the code will be left in CVS, but the user won't be able to 
build it.

Regarding the release schedule, it seems we can stick to it very closely. The 
first beta release will be made next weekend.

Best regards
Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.0beta1 released
Message-ID: <1546318620@web.de>

The first beta release of the upcoming Smb4K 0.10.0 has been made available today. It comes with several bug fixes and changes compared to the alpha release. The most prominent modification is the termination of the support of the deprecated SMBFS file system (Linux and similar operating systems). It is not needed anymore now that the support of the CIFS file system in Samba has matured and the mounting of W9x shares is possible. For all changes refer to the ChangeLog file enclosed in the source tarball.

After some discussion, we decided to not port the Konqueror plugin to KDE 4 for now but keep the source until a final decision has been made. You can still participate in our  survey [1] to tell us your opinion on this matter.

If you want to compile the source, please have a look at the announcement of Smb4K 0.10.0alpha [2] on how to work with the new cmake build system.

Since this is a pre-release, there are still most definetly bugs. Thus, all users are encourged to report any bugs to our bug tracker [3]. We explicitly want to thank all users who already did this and helped to improve Smb4K.

The ChangeLog and the release notes can be viewed at [2] and the source code of the first beta version can be downloaded from [4].

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Translations frozen & delay of second beta
Message-ID: <200807201440.39239.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

Hello everyone,

with today's commit I uploaded the last message changes before Smb4K 0.10.0 is 
tagged. If you haven't started already, you can now begin to translate.

The second beta version is delayed by one or two days due to changes I applied 
just yesterday that need to be tested. Namely, the support of the program 
'super' has been terminated. I do not use it anymore and since 'sudo' is the 
standard, there are no reasons to still support 'super'.

Have a nice weekend

Bye
Alexander

Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K 0.10.0beta2 released
Message-ID: <200807250828.31710.alexander.reinholdt@web.de>

The second beta of Smb4K 0.10.0 has been released. It mainly focuses on the 
completion of the main window and on fixing bugs, but we also removed the 
support for the suid program 'super' that does not belong to standard 
installation of most distributions. If you were using 'super', please 
reconfigure Smb4K.

For a full list of changes please have a look at the ChangeLog file in the 
source tarball.

We want to encourage our users to give Smb4K 0.10.0beta2 a try and report any 
bugs to our bug tracker [1], so that we can improve it before the release. The 
final version is expected to be released in the beginning of August.
The release notes can be viewed [2] and the source code of this beta release 
can be downloaded from [3].
