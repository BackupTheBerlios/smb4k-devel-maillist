Subject: [smb4k-devel] Smb4K moves to Sourceforge
Message-ID: <2960351.gpe6iDrUPf@dustpuppy>

We were notified that BerliOS will be closed on 31.12.2011. Due to this fact, 
we will move Smb4K over to Sourceforge. The project page already exists and 
will be populated with the project's files within the next days and weeks. If 
you have bookmarked our old project's web site http://smb4k.berlios.de, please 
replace it with http://smb4k.sf.net.

We would like to thank BerliOS for hosting the Smb4K project over the last 
eight years!

For the Smb4K team
Alexander Reinholdt
