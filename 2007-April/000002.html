<PRE>Today, we are releasing version 0.8.1 of Smb4K, the SMB/CIFS share browser for 
KDE. It mainly contains security fixes for the utility programs and every 
user is strongly adviced to update.

Overview: Smb4K 0.8.1 comes with new versions of the utility programs, that 
have been rewritten from scratch to account for several security weaknesses 
(see below) that were discovered by Ben Hutchings after version 0.8.0 was 
released. During the rewite, we tried to stay compatible with previous 
versions of the utility programs, but with smb4k_kill this was  not possible: 
The signal number was removed from the arguments list. Because of this, the 
new version cannot be used as a direct replacement of previous versions. 
Please use the respective patches, if necessary.

Besides the security fixes, there are a few other improvements: Smb4K now uses
the CIFS file system by default, because several distributions already have 
removed support for the SMBFS one. In addition, we started to address the 
browsing problems several users experienced in Active Directory environments 
and - hopefully - fixed the NT_STATUS_ACCOUNT_DISABLED error. Two more 
annoying bugs in the Smb4KFileIO class and two compilation errors were also 
corrected. The full list of changes can be found below.

Security Issues: Ben Hutchings discovered the following security weaknesses in 
the utility programs:
- Due to insufficient sanitation, smb4k_mount allowed an user to mount any
  (local) device if the program was used in combination with sudo or super.
- The function findprog(), which was in present smb4k_mount, smb4k_umount, and 
  smb4k_kill, returned a pointer to memory that was freed when the function
  exited.
- The function replace_special_characters(), that was present in smb4k_mount
  and smb4k_umount, returned a pointer to memory that was freed after the
  function exited. Additionally, it didn't replace the hyphen.

MD5 sum: 49d7a58f751d04c6c0697ee5e5912d4d  smb4k-0.8.1.tar.bz2
SHA1 sum:&lt;/b&gt; 8b4c87226a2bdd9e7ec0d853e498a09fcbda4b80 smb4k-0.8.1.tar.bz2

ChangeLog Smb4K 0.8.1:
- Rewrote smb4k_mount, smb4k_umount, smb4k_kill, smb4k_cat, and smb4k_mv from
  scratch in order to fix the following security weaknesses discovered by 
  Ben Hutchings (should finally close #9631):
  + Due to insufficient sanitation, smb4k_mount allowed an user to mount any
    (local) device if the program was used in combination with sudo or super.
  + The function findprog(), which was in present smb4k_mount, smb4k_umount,
    and smb4k_kill, returned a pointer to memory that was freed when the
    function exited.
  + The function replace_special_characters(), that was present in smb4k_mount
    and smb4k_umount, returned a pointer to memory that was freed after the
    function exited. Additionally, it didn't replace the hyphen.
- Changes in smb4k_mount:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line options.
  + Added '-n' and '-s' switches (not under FreeBSD) as short forms of the
    '--suid' and '--no-suid' arguments, respectively.
  + Added '--version' argument.
  + Out of the many arguments that may be passed to the 'mount' binary, only
    '-t &lt;filesystem&gt;' and '-o &lt;options&gt;' are still supported with smb4k_mount.
  + All file systems except 'smbfs' and 'cifs' will result in an error.
  + Fixed order of the arguments that were passed to 'mount.cifs' and
    'smbmount' (the '-o &lt;options&gt;' argument must be placed at the end).
  + Added check if a share in the form //HOST/SHARE is supplied. If this is
    not the case, smb4k_mount will error out.
  + Improved FreeBSD support.
- Changes in smb4k_umount:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '-n' and '-s' switches (not under FreeBSD) as short forms of the
    '--suid' and '--no-suid' arguments, respectively.
  + Added '--version' argument.
  + Added check if a mount point is supplied at all.
  + Improved FreeBSD support.
  + The '--smbfs' and '--cifs' arguments have been deprecated and are now
    inoperable. They are still present for backward compatibility, but may be
    removed any time soon.
- Changes in smb4k_kill:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '--version' argument.
  + smb4k_kill does not take a signal number anymore. You can only terminate
    a process with the SIGTERM signal.
- Changes in smb4k_cat:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '--version' argument.
- Changes in smb4k_mv:
  + Moved to getopt_long() to parse the command line arguments.
  + Added '--version' argument.
  + Added a check if the source and destination files are regular files. If
    they are not, smb4k_mv will error out.
- Adjusted Smb4KMounter class to the slightly changed behavior of the utility
  programs:
  + Removed SIGTERM signal from command line in Smb4KMounter::abort() because
    of the changes made to smb4k_kill.
  + Changed the command lines for smb4k_mount and smb4k_umount.
- Started to address the browsing problems experienced by users in Active
  Directory environments: If the NT_STATUS_ACCOUNT_DISABLED error is
  encountered (which actually seems to be an authentication issue), Smb4K
  won't error out anymore but ask the user for the user name and password
  (closes #10280).
- Fixed two bugs in Smb4KFileIO:
  + The search for the lock file directory will not return a directory that is
    not readable and writeable anymore (except /var and /tmp are mounted ro).
  + If the lock file does not exist when Smb4KFileIO::removeLockFile() wants
    to delete it, no error will be shown anymore.
- Fixed a compilation error under SUSE (10.2) und with the upcoming GCC 4.3.
- Smb4K now uses the CIFS file system by default (closes #10804).
- The handbook was updated to reflect the changes made to the utility  
  programs.

Due to the severity of the security weaknessses, we also released security 
fixes for Smb4K 0.7.5 and 0.6.10a. All other versions are not supported 
anymore.
